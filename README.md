# RULE-ENGINE-WITH
1. Project Title
Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

2. Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a 3-tier rule engine application that determines user eligibility based on specific attributes like age, department, income, and spend. This application will leverage an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules, enabling the dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

3. System Architecture
Overview
The project is structured as a 3-tier application:

Frontend (UI Layer): Provides an interface for defining eligibility rules and displaying results.
API Layer: Receives and parses user input and rules, constructs an AST, and sends eligibility results back.
Backend Logic and Data Layer: Manages rule definitions, stores user data, and evaluates rules using AST.

4. Technologies Used
API Layer: Java Spring Boot (for API and rule parsing)
Backend Logic: Java (for rule processing and AST evaluation)
AST Parsing: Using Java classes for rule expressions
Project Components and Functionalities
5.1 Frontend (UI Layer)
Allows user to input attributes (age, department, income, spend).
Lets user define eligibility rules (e.g., age > 18 && income > 50000).
Displays eligibility results.
5.2 API Layer
The API layer:

Receives requests with user attributes and rules.
Converts rules into an AST and evaluates them.
Returns eligibility results to the frontend.
Example API Endpoint:

POST /check-eligibility: Accepts user data and rule strings, parses them into AST, and evaluates the rules.
5.3 Backend Logic (AST and Data Layer)
The backend is responsible for:

Parsing rules into AST: The rule strings are converted into ASTs using Java objects.
Evaluating AST: Traverses the AST to evaluate conditions based on user data.
Storing Rules: Allows for predefined or dynamically created rules.
6. Implementation Details
6.1 Parsing and Evaluating Rules with AST in Java
Step 1: Convert rule strings into an AST using Java classes.
Example Rule: "age > 18 && income > 50000"
Step 2: Evaluate the AST nodes recursively.
Binary Expressions (e.g., >, <) are evaluated by comparing left and right expressions.
Identifiers refer to user data attributes (e.g., age).
Literals represent static values (e.g., 18).
6.2 Code Snippets
Java Classes for AST Nodes:

ASTNode: Abstract base class for AST nodes.
Binary Expression: Represents binary operations (e.g., >, &&).
Literal: Represents constant values (e.g., age values).
Identifier: Represents variables (e.g., age, income).
Results
The system successfully evaluates eligibility by applying dynamic rules. AST evaluation enables flexible rule creation and accurate eligibility processing.
. Future Enhancements
Enhanced Rule Composition: Allow nested and complex rules.
Role-Based Access: Implement access levels for rule creation or viewing.
Rule Versioning: Track rule changes over time to manage versions.
 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to implement a rule-based eligibility engine in Java using ASTs. The system allows for flexible rule manipulation, efficient eligibility determination, and scalable architecture, showcasing the AST's benefits in building adaptable, rule-based applications.
